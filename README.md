❤️ Federated HeartCare
Privacy-Preserving & Drift-Aware Heart Disease Prediction System
📌 Project Overview

Federated HeartCare is a privacy-preserving and adaptive heart disease prediction system that combines Federated Learning and Concept Drift Detection to provide reliable and personalized cardiac risk assessment.
Instead of collecting sensitive patient data on a central server, the system trains models locally on distributed clients and shares only model parameters, ensuring data confidentiality.

The system dynamically adapts to lifestyle changes (typical, athletic, diver) using a drift-aware model swapping mechanism, maintaining high prediction accuracy over time.

🎯 Objectives

Preserve patient data privacy using federated learning

Detect physiological changes using concept drift detection

Adapt models dynamically for different user profiles

Provide real-time heart disease prediction through a UI
